# Drone Pathfinding AI

A self-contained C++17 project implementing intelligent drone navigation using reinforcement learning, featuring both discrete Q-learning and vision-based deep learning approaches.

<!-- Repository language detection fix applied -->

## üöÅ Project Overview

This project implements a lightweight drone simulator with two learning tracks:

- **Track A (Q-Learning)**: Traditional reinforcement learning using discrete state spaces and Q-tables
